Welcome to the first coding activity of the day!

For this activity, will be creating a webpage of our class schedule.

*(Note: Refrain from asking help to Sir Roy for the day, and instead ask help from an idle host :D)*

Now, the following text will be a step-to-step guide as to how to proceed with the activity.

### Activity Details:

- You will be creating a schedule of your classes for one of the days! 
- We will be teaching you how to create tables in CSS, and how to contain media within CSS.

### Step-by-step Guide:

1. Create an HTML File in your VSCode. You may choose to follow this format: `Salitan2025_ClassAct.html`
2. Input your typical elements that allows your file to run:
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<link href='https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lexend'rel='stylesheet'>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<styles>
</styles> <!-- allows for CSS inside code.-->
</head>
<body>

</body>
</html>
