Here is a step-by-step guide as to how you and your partner can start collaborating on GitHub! :)
#### Instructions: 
1. You and your partner should log-in both of your GitHub accounts.
2. Create a new repository. For K29's Salitan 2025, we will follow the naming format of: `CS3_Salitan2025_Potassium_{CN01}_{CN02}`
3. Navigate to the main page of your repository.
4. Once in the webpage, go to: `Settings > Access > Collaborators`
5. Click `Add People` and input the username or email of your partner, and then click `Add to repository`
6. Check the email of your partner for the invite, and once received, let your partner accept the invite.
7. Now both of you are collaborating in GitHub! Enjoy the future projects that you'll have together!

To start on your code:

1. Open a new window in VSCode through right-clicking it in your Menu.
2. Go to the search bar and type: `> Git: Clone`
3. Find your joint repository and click it.
4. Now you can start coding with your partner! :D

(Note: Do not forget to routinely request pushes and pulls from your repositories from GitHub to VSCode 😀)

Now that you have linked your repositories, open it up in your VSCode, and start working on your first project as a pair!:
